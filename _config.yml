  I am a full-stack developer with about 3 years of experience in the field. I have worked mostly with educational institutes and collaborations with other developers and designers. 
  <br><br>
  My specialty is in back-end development, but I have loved front-end work for as long as I can remember. I try my best to keep track of the changing trends in web and mobile development so that I can adapt and use what I learn to improve myself. I like to work hard and I do my best to get my work done as efficiently as possible.
